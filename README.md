# Bikeshed.rs Demo

This is a prototype of bikeshed-rs, a project of Mozilla in Google Summer Of Code 2020. The goal of this project is to offer a faithful rewrite of [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed), a tool used for generating many standards, in Rust. I built this prototype for the proposal.

Usage: `cargo run spec <infile> [outfile]`
